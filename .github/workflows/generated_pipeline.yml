# Refactoring Suggestions
# Follow naming conventions for Jenkins resources

// -- Jenkins Pipeline Optimization Suggestions --
// - Include a 'post' section for better visibility into pipeline success or failure.
// - Use parameters to make the pipeline reusable for different environments or builds.

# CI/CD Tip: Automate your deployment process with stages like Build, Test, and Deploy. Use proper error handling and post-build actions to ensure stability.

# Terraform Tip: Use separate workspaces for dev/staging/prod environments. Automate Terraform with GitHub Actions using init, validate, plan, and apply stages. Store the Terraform state securely (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB for locking).
