# # Transform the Jenkins pipeline script below into an equivalent GitHub Actions workflow.

# ## Guidelines:
# - Use `jobs` and `steps` structure.
# - Replace shell commands (`sh`) with `run`.
# - Use GitHub Actions' built-in actions like `actions/checkout@v3`.
# - Use `secrets` instead of Jenkins `credentialsId`.
# - Follow GitHub Actions YAML best practices.
# - Preserve stage names and logical flow.
